    <h1> Warmzy as a concept</h1>
    <p>Warmzy started out from 2 KdG students called Jolien and Donna who had the idea to start out a
        company to help out people who get cold feet and hands really quick. This concept
        got even better when they found out a way to warm the gloves and soles with out
        using any materials but only kinetic energy. This already is way better than all
        the competition on the market who only have the option of rechargeable/reaction gloves and soles.

    <h1> What do we sell?</h1>
    <p>We sell high fashion gloves and soles! They are made from the finest materials. With that we are also vegan! 
        That means that all our products are plant based without using any animal testing. All our gloves were user tested with customer support
        so that we know what kind of market we are hitting! The soles are also designed for people
        that have sweaty feet. That mean's you won't get cold when you sweating. <br><br>

    <h2 >Who do we target?</h2>
    <p>We target people who had just about enough of cold hands and feet. Most of the time normal shoes and gloves don't even give good
        enough protection against the cold.The same goes for people with Raynaud's disease. We specially engineeerd the mittens and gloves that the warmth is spread evenly.</p>
